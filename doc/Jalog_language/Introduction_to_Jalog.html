Jalog is a dialect of Prolog. So, this presentation is mainly about generic 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>. Specifics of Jalog are emphasized.
Prolog programming language is intended for solving logical problems. Examples of such problems are:
<ul>
<li>finding airline connections from origin to destination,</li>
<li>writing real-time control software from specifications,</li>
<li>designing the control system hardware list and connections from specifications of an elevator system,</li>
<li>configuring a mobile phone UI software from a feature list,</li>
<li>designing non repeating tiling with different sized tiles,</li>
<li>solving Sudoku problem (provided as an example).</li>
</ul>
</p>

Prolog is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn clauses</a>. So, its theoretical foundings are quite robust.
</p>
<p>
A Prolog program consists of <em>predicates</em>. Predicates consist of <em>facts</em> or <em>rules</em> or both. Execution of a Prolog program is in principle trying solve a problem with a solution that is based on facts and rules of the program.
</p>
<p>
Examples of facts
<pre>
road(joensuu, kajaani, 230). % 230 km road connection from Joensuu to Kajaani
road(kajaani, oulu, 183). % 183 km road connection from Kajaani to Oulu
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Examples of rules
<pre>
% There town1 and town2 are connected, if there is a road between them
% defined in either direction. The length of a connection is the length of the
% road.
connected(Town1, Town2, Length) :- road(Town1, Town2, Length).
connected(Town1, Town2, Length) :- road(Town2, Town1, Length).

% There is a route from a town to itself - trivial case.
route(Town, Town, 0).
% There is a route from Town1 to Town2, if the Town1 is connected to some TownX
% and there is a route from TownX to Town2. The length of the route is the sum
% of the lengths of the connection and the route.
route(Town1, Town2, Length) :- 
    connected(Town1, TownX, Length1), 
    route(TownX, Town2, Length2),
    Length = Length1 + Length2.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
A Prolog program is started using a <em>query</em>. A query is a predicate name with zero or more arguments.
</p>
<p>
The Prolog program responds to a query by trying to find such a fact that <em>matches</em> the query, or a rule whose subgoals succeeds with given variable values.
