Jalog is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>. So, this presentation is largely applicable to generic 
Prolog. This presentation is focused on specifics of Jalog.
Prolog programming language is intended for solving logical problems. Examples of such problems are:
<ul>
<li>finding airline connections from origin to destination,</li>
<li>writing real-time control software from specifications,</li>
<li>designing the control system hardware list and connections from specifications,</li>
<li>designing non repeating tiling with different sized tiles,</li>
<li>solving Sudoku problem (provided as an <a href="https://jalogteam.github.io/sudoku_demo/sudoku_example.html">example</a>).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Prolog is based on the mathematical theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause">Horn clauses</a>. So, its theoretical foundings are quite robust.
</p>
<p>
A Prolog program consists of <em>predicates</em>. Predicates consist of <em>facts</em> or <em>rules</em> or both. Execution of a Prolog program is in principle trying solve a problem with a solution that is based on facts and rules of the program.
</p>
<p>
Examples of facts
<pre>
road(joensuu, kajaani, 230). % 230 km road connection from Joensuu to Kajaani
road(kajaani, oulu, 183). % 183 km road connection from Kajaani to Oulu
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Examples of rules
<pre>
% There town1 and town2 are connected, if there is a road between them
% defined in either direction. The length of a connection is the length of the
% road.
connected(Town1, Town2, Length) :- road(Town1, Town2, Length).
connected(Town1, Town2, Length) :- road(Town2, Town1, Length).

% There is a route from a town to itself - trivial case.
route(Town, Town, 0).
% There is a route from Town1 to Town2, if the Town1 is connected to some TownX
% and there is a route from TownX to Town2. The length of the route is the sum
% of the lengths of the connection and the route.
route(Town1, Town2, Length) :- 
    connected(Town1, TownX, Length1), 
    route(TownX, Town2, Length2),
    Length = Length1 + Length2.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Before a program can be executed it is loaded to the <i>database</i>. 
</p>
<p>
An execution of a Prolog program is started using a <em>query</em>. A query is a predicate name with zero or more arguments. The Prolog system searches the database for facts and rules that match the query.  The query can be given in the Prolog program (at the end) or (as a special feature of Jalog) in a Java program.
</p>
<p>
The Prolog program responds to a query by trying to find such a fact that <em>matches</em> the query, or a rule whose subgoals succeeds with given variable values.
</p>
<p>
Examples of queries:
<pre>
:- road(oulu, joensuu, Len). % Is there a road from Oulu to Joensuu?
<span style="font-family:initial">Prints: </span>*No*

% How long is the route from Oulu to Joensuu?
:- route(oulu, joensuu, Len), write(Len, ' '). 
<span style="font-family:initial">Prints: </span>413 *Yes*
</pre>
</p>
What happens when a query is executed?
<p>
<pre>:- road(oulu, joensuu, Len).</pre>
The Prolog system searches the database for facts and rules starting with the word <code>road</code>. Two facts are found but neither of them has both the first and the second argument right. Therefore no fact matches the goal, and the answer is <code>*No*</code>.
</p>
<p>
The execution of the second example is more complicated.
<pre>:- route(oulu, joensuu, Len), write(Len, ' ').</pre>
The Prolog system searches the database for facts and rules starting with the word <code>route</code>. First the fact <code>route(Town, Town, 0)</code> is found. However, this does not match because the first two arguments of the query are not equal. Next a rule with the head <code>route(Town1, Town2, Length)</code> is found. This matches, because there is no constraint on arguments. From this point on <code>Town1</code> is <code>oulu</code> and <code>Town2</code> is <code>joensuu</code>. The <code>length</code> is still <i>open</i>, i.e. not yet determined. The first query in the rule is specified as <code>connected(Town1, TownX, Length1)</code>. Using the known variable values the query to be executed is <code>connected(oulu, TownX, Length1)</code>.
